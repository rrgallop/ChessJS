# ChessJS
Learned some things building chess in python, and figured it'd be fun to take a crack at designing the game again in a new language. In this project I've implemented enforcement of check, so only moves that will not put your king in jeoprady are considered valid. 

In the future I would like to make some performance improvements. There are also a couple legal moves that you can't perform on this chessboard that I would like to implement (en passant and castling). 

Otherwise, this was a fun project to implement that you are welcome to play with.
